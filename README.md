Simple and straightforward yui compressor wrapper plugin

Supports aggregation and compression of javascript and css sources.

Compared to http://alchim.sourceforge.net/yuicompressor-maven-plugin/ works with m2e incremental build. Also 
has much smaller and arguably cleaner codebase.

Note that original project does not appear to be in development any longer. There is a github fork with recent
activities https://github.com/davidB/yuicompressor-maven-plugin/
